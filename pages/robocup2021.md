## Intention of participation

If you are interested to participate please take the time to pre-register your team for the RoboCup 2021 Virtual Robot Competition as soon as possible, so that we can inform you about the latest developments. The current plan is to give the teams remote access to a competition platform by using a cloud computing service. To know the scale of the cloud computing server, we need to know the number of participating teams. The ultimate deadline for pre-registration is set on March 31, 2021.


## Qualification material

Besides sending the intention of participation, please prepare before May 2, 2021, a Team Description Paper describing the most innovative contributions or scientific results your team is intended to provide.

The TDP is limited to 8 pages and must be formatted according to the LNCS format:

http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines

And the tex template file of the TDP can be found on the overleaf:

https://www.overleaf.com/read/nrcfnpygskyx

The Team Description Paper is an overview of the methodologies you use or intend to use to control your robots inside the Virtual Robot Competition. If applicable, include a reference to your latest publications.

The qualification material should be placed on a dedicated web page on the team’s home page.

Please include the link to the qualification material on the intention of participation information.
