# Navigation Demo

The main purpose of this demo is to get acquainted with how to set up a navigation system in the virtual robot project. In navigation demo, a single PA3T robot is spawned in an unknown engravement and tries to find a safe way to move from point A to point B. This will complete dynamic path planning, compute velocities for motors, avoid obstacles, and structure recovery behaviors. To learn more about this project, see [nav2 project homepage](https://navigation.ros.org/). 

This page will be completed in the coming days.
